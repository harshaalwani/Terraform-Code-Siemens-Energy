# Terraform-Code-Siemens-Energy
This Terraform module deploys a scalable web application infrastructure on AWS, including a VPC with public and private subnets, an autoscaling group, a load balancer, and an SSL certificate for test.example.com. Additionally, it configures the web servers using Ansible.
Prerequisites
AWS account with appropriate permissions to create VPC, EC2 instances, Load Balancers, Route 53 hosted zones, and IAM roles.
Terraform installed on your local machine.

Usage
Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd terraform/

Initialize Terraform:
terraform init
Review and Modify Configuration:

Review and modify the variables in variables.tf file:
Terraform Apply:terraform apply

Configure DNS:

After Terraform deployment, configure your DNS settings in AWS Route 53 private hosted zone to resolve test.example.com internally within the VPC.
Access Web Application:

Once the deployment is complete, the web application will be accessible at the Load Balancer DNS name provided in the Terraform output.
Inputs

Describe the input variables used in your Terraform modules.
Outputs
Specify Outputs Here:
Describe the outputs of your Terraform modules that might be useful for users, such as Load Balancer DNS name.
Important Design Decisions
VPC Configuration:

Explain any specific VPC configuration decisions made, such as CIDR blocks, subnet allocation, etc.
Security Group Rules:

Describe the security group rules implemented for securing the infrastructure, including minimal ports opened for communication.
SSL Certificate:

Explain how the self-signed SSL certificate for test.example.com is generated and used in the load balancer configuration.
Ansible Configuration:

Detail how Ansible is utilized to configure the web servers, including the roles and playbooks used.
Security Considerations
Sensitive Information:

Advise users not to hardcode sensitive information and to follow best practices for secure handling of credentials and keys.
Regular Updates:

Encourage users to keep the configurations up-to-date based on security recommendations and changes in requirements.
